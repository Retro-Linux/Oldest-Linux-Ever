This is a good start of leaning Linux kernel.

This git repository contains two branches :-

Original branch which i pulled original source code  [linux-0.01.tar.gz](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/linux-0.01.tar.gz "linux-0.01.tar.gz").

And This Main branch which i had compilable patched kernel ver 0.01 [Linux 0.01 remake](http://draconux.free.fr/os_dev/linux0.01.html "Linux 0.01 remake").
Thanks to @Abdel Benamrouche
